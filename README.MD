# 📦 YOLOv8 Object Detection Web App

This project provides a [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) web application to load, test, and validate custom-trained Ultralytics YOLOv8 models.

You can perform two main actions:
1.  **Live Prediction:** Upload any image to get instant object detection results from your model.
2.  **Model Validation:** Run the official `model.val()` on your test dataset (as defined in `yolo_params.yaml`) and see the performance metrics and graphs.

## 📂 Project Structure

Your project **must** follow this directory structure for the app to find your models and data:
your_project_root/ │ ├── 🚀 app.py # The Streamlit Web Application ├── 📝 yolo_params.yaml # Your YOLO configuration file (must link to your dataset) │ ├── 📦 runs/ │ └── detect/ │ ├── train/ # Your YOLO training output folder │ │ └── weights/ │ │ └── best.pt # The model to be loaded │ ├── train2/ │ │ └── weights/ │ │ └── best.pt │ └── ... │ └── 🖼️ your_dataset/ # Your dataset folder (as defined in yolo_params.yaml) ├── test/ │ └── images/ └── ...

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

This guide assumes you have **Conda** installed.

1.  **Create a Conda Environment**
    Open your terminal and create a new environment.
    ```bash
    conda create -n yolo_app python=3.10
    ```

2.  **Activate the Environment**
    You must activate the environment every time you run the app.
    ```bash
    conda activate yolo_app
    ```

3.  **Install Required Packages**
    Install all the necessary libraries into your new environment.
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit ultralytics opencv-python-headless PyYAML pillow
    ```

## 🏃 How to Run the App

1.  **Navigate to Your Project**
    Open your terminal and change to the project's root directory (where `app.py` is located).
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your_project_root
    ```

2.  **Activate Your Environment**
    If you haven't already, activate your conda environment.
    ```bash
    conda activate yolo_app
    ```

3.  **Run the Streamlit App**
    This is the main command to start the web server.
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

4.  **Open in Browser**
    Your terminal will show you a "Local URL". Copy this URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`) and paste it into your web browser.

The application is now running!

### Using the App


* **Model Selection:** The sidebar will automatically find all `best.pt` models located in your `runs/detect/` subfolders. Select the one you want to use.
* **Live Prediction Tab:** Upload an image and adjust the confidence slider to see your model predict in real-time.
* **Model Validation Tab:** Click the "Run Validation" button to test your selected model against the test set defined in your **`yolo_params.yaml`** file.
